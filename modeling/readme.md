# Modeling Folder

This folder contains all code, data, and requirements for model training, evaluation, and MLflow logging. Here you:

- Develop and experiment with machine learning models (e.g., in Jupyter notebooks).
- Prepare and preprocess data (see the `data/` subfolder).
- Train, validate, and log models to MLflow for versioning and deployment.
- Export models and artifacts for use by the serving API.

Use this folder as your workspace for iterating on model development before pushing models to production.
